# OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

Trace agent execution, LLM calls, tool usage, and handoffs using OpenTelemetry. Compatible with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) and any OTel-compatible backend.

## Overview

The `Agents::Instrumentation` module produces OTel spans that give you full visibility into agent execution:

- **LLM generation spans** with model name, token counts, and input/output
- **Tool execution spans** with arguments and results
- **Agent container spans** grouping related LLM and tool calls
- **Handoff events** recording agent-to-agent transfers

Generation inputs include MIME types for RubyLLM message attachments. Their URLs, local paths, and image data are omitted. Structured image inputs also omit the image URL.

Spans follow the [GenAI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) and include Langfuse-specific attributes for rich rendering in the Langfuse dashboard.

### RubyLLM 2.0 events and Langfuse

RubyLLM 2.0 emits `chat.ruby_llm`, `tool_call.ruby_llm`, and `usage.ruby_llm` events. In Rails, these use `ActiveSupport::Notifications`. Outside Rails, configure a RubyLLM instrumenter to receive them. The events are useful for logging and per-attempt usage, but RubyLLM does not turn them into this runner's Langfuse trace. Keep `Agents::Instrumentation` when you need the following mapping:

| Runner span or event | Data in Langfuse | RubyLLM event alone |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Root span | Overall input and output, session, user, tags, and Chatwoot metadata | No runner-level input, output, or Chatwoot context |
| Agent span | Agent name and the generations and tools it owns | No agent handoff boundary |
| Generation span | Request messages, response, model, temperature, and response tokens | `chat.ruby_llm` has the model and response, but needs an OTLP and Langfuse attribute adapter |
| Tool span | Tool arguments, result, and error status | `tool_call.ruby_llm` has the call, but needs the same adapter |
| Handoff event | Source agent, target agent, and reason | No RubyLLM handoff event for this runner |

RubyLLM's `usage.ruby_llm` event reports each provider attempt, including failed and cancelled attempts. The generation spans here use tokens from completed messages. Use a separate `usage.ruby_llm` subscriber for attempt-level accounting; do not add its tokens to the same generation spans or costs may be counted twice. See the [RubyLLM instrumentation guide](https://rubyllm.com/instrumentation/) for event payloads.

For an app outside Rails, add `activesupport` and configure RubyLLM before creating a chat:

```ruby
require "active_support"
require "active_support/notifications"

RubyLLM.configure do |config|
  config.instrumenter = ActiveSupport::Notifications
end

ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("usage.ruby_llm") do |event|
  puts event.payload.inspect # Replace with your per-attempt usage collector.
end
```

This enables RubyLLM's native events. The runner spans still require `Agents::Instrumentation.install` and an OTel exporter, as shown below.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "opentelemetry-sdk"
gem "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp"
```

Then run `bundle install`.

### 2. Configure the OTel SDK

```ruby
require "opentelemetry-sdk"
require "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp"

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.add_span_processor(
    OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Export::BatchSpanProcessor.new(
      OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Exporter.new(
        endpoint: "https://your-otel-endpoint/v1/traces",
        headers: { "Authorization" => "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" }
      )
    )
  )
end
```

### 3. Install on a runner

```ruby
require "agents/instrumentation"

tracer = OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.tracer("my-app")
runner = Agents::Runner.with_agents(triage, billing, support)

Agents::Instrumentation.install(runner, tracer: tracer)
```

That's it. Every `runner.run(...)` call now produces OTel spans.

## Span Hierarchy

```
root (agents.run)
├── agent.Calculator           # container span per agent (no model attr)
│   ├── agents.run.generation  # GENERATION: model, tokens, I/O
│   ├── agents.run.tool.add    # TOOL: arguments + result
│   └── agents.run.generation  # second LLM call after tool result
├── agent.Support              # after handoff
│   └── agents.run.generation
└── agents.run.handoff         # point event on root span
```

**Only GENERATION spans carry `gen_ai.request.model`**. This prevents Langfuse from double-counting costs when it sums token usage across spans with a model attribute.

## Configuration Options

### `trace_name`

Custom name for the root span (default: `"agents.run"`):

```ruby
Agents::Instrumentation.install(runner,
  tracer: tracer,
  trace_name: "customer_support.run"
)
```

Child spans derive their names: `customer_support.run.generation`, `customer_support.run.tool.add_numbers`, etc.

### `span_attributes`

Static attributes applied to the root span:

```ruby
Agents::Instrumentation.install(runner,
  tracer: tracer,
  span_attributes: {
    "langfuse.trace.tags" => '["production","v2"]',
    "langfuse.session.id" => session_id
  }
)
```

### `attribute_provider`

A lambda that receives the context wrapper and returns dynamic attributes:

```ruby
Agents::Instrumentation.install(runner,
  tracer: tracer,
  attribute_provider: ->(ctx) {
    {
      "langfuse.user.id" => ctx.context[:user_id].to_s,
      "langfuse.session.id" => ctx.context[:session_id].to_s
    }
  }
)
```

## Langfuse Integration

### Endpoint and Authentication

Langfuse accepts OTel traces at `{LANGFUSE_HOST}/api/public/otel/v1/traces`. Authentication uses HTTP Basic with your public and secret keys:

```ruby
require "base64"

langfuse_host = ENV["LANGFUSE_HOST"] # e.g. "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
langfuse_pk   = ENV["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"]
langfuse_sk   = ENV["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"]

auth_token = Base64.strict_encode64("#{langfuse_pk}:#{langfuse_sk}")

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.add_span_processor(
    OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Export::BatchSpanProcessor.new(
      OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Exporter.new(
        endpoint: "#{langfuse_host}/api/public/otel/v1/traces",
        headers: { "Authorization" => "Basic #{auth_token}", "x-langfuse-ingestion-version" => "4" }
      )
    )
  )
end
```

### Attribute Mapping

The instrumentation sets Langfuse-specific attributes that map to the Langfuse UI:

| Attribute | Set On | Langfuse Display |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| `langfuse.trace.input` | Root span | Legacy trace input for existing evaluators |
| `langfuse.trace.output` | Root span | Legacy trace output for existing evaluators |
| `langfuse.observation.input` | All spans | Observation input (sidebar click) |
| `langfuse.observation.output` | All spans | Observation output (sidebar click) |
| `langfuse.observation.type` | Tool spans | `"tool"` type indicator |
| `langfuse.user.id` | Root span (via attribute_provider) | User filter/display |
| `langfuse.session.id` | Root span (via attribute_provider) | Session grouping |
| `langfuse.trace.tags` | Root span (via span_attributes) | Trace tags |
| `gen_ai.request.model` | Generation spans only | Model name + cost calculation |
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` | Generation spans | Token usage |
| `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | Generation spans | Token usage |
| `gen_ai.usage.reasoning.output_tokens` | Generation spans, when reported | Reasoning tokens within output tokens |
| `langfuse.observation.metadata.reasoning_summary` | Responses generation spans with `thinking: { display: :summarized }` | Returned summary, when provided |

Langfuse v4 reads overall input and output from `langfuse.observation.input` and `langfuse.observation.output` on the root span. This integration also keeps the deprecated trace input and output attributes for existing consumers. The Langfuse v4 ingestion path needs the `x-langfuse-ingestion-version: 4` exporter header. See the [Langfuse migration guide](https://langfuse.com/integrations/native/opentelemetry/migration-to-v4).

Reasoning tokens are already part of output tokens, so do not add the two counts. The summary field records only text returned for a requested Responses summary. Encrypted reasoning signatures stay in conversation history for stateless replay and are not added to Langfuse spans. Treat persisted conversation history as sensitive data.

### EU vs US Cloud

- **US**: `https://cloud.langfuse.com`
- **EU**: `https://eu.cloud.langfuse.com`

Set `LANGFUSE_HOST` accordingly. Self-hosted instances use your own URL.

## Complete Example

```ruby
require "agents"
require "agents/instrumentation"
require "opentelemetry-sdk"
require "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp"
require "base64"

# --- Configure Agents ---
Agents.configure do |config|
  config.openai_api_key = ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
  config.default_model = "gpt-4o-mini"
end

# --- Configure OTel with Langfuse ---
langfuse_host = ENV.fetch("LANGFUSE_HOST", "https://cloud.langfuse.com")
auth_token = Base64.strict_encode64(
  "#{ENV["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"]}:#{ENV["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"]}"
)

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.add_span_processor(
    OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Export::BatchSpanProcessor.new(
      OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Exporter.new(
        endpoint: "#{langfuse_host}/api/public/otel/v1/traces",
        headers: { "Authorization" => "Basic #{auth_token}", "x-langfuse-ingestion-version" => "4" }
      )
    )
  )
end

tracer = OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.tracer("my-app")

# --- Build agents ---
triage = Agents::Agent.new(name: "Triage", instructions: "Route users...")
billing = Agents::Agent.new(name: "Billing", instructions: "Handle billing...")
support = Agents::Agent.new(name: "Support", instructions: "Technical support...")

triage.register_handoffs(billing, support)
billing.register_handoffs(triage)
support.register_handoffs(triage)

# --- Create runner with instrumentation ---
runner = Agents::Runner.with_agents(triage, billing, support)

Agents::Instrumentation.install(runner,
  tracer: tracer,
  trace_name: "customer_support",
  attribute_provider: ->(ctx) {
    {
      "langfuse.user.id" => ctx.context[:user_id].to_s,
      "langfuse.session.id" => ctx.context[:session_id].to_s
    }
  }
)

# --- Run conversations ---
result = runner.run("I have a billing question",
  context: { user_id: "user_123", session_id: "sess_456" })

puts result.output

# Ensure spans are flushed before exit
at_exit { OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.force_flush }
```

## Troubleshooting

### "undefined" values in Langfuse

Langfuse renders empty string attributes as "undefined". The instrumentation guards against this by not setting attributes when values are nil or empty. If you see "undefined", check that your agents are producing output content.

### Double-counted costs

If token costs appear inflated, verify that `gen_ai.request.model` is only set on GENERATION spans, not on container or root spans. `Agents::Instrumentation` handles this by default. If you set custom `span_attributes` that include `gen_ai.request.model`, costs will be double-counted.

### Empty spans / missing data

- Ensure `opentelemetry-sdk` is installed (not just `opentelemetry-api`)
- Call `OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.force_flush` before process exit
- Verify your OTLP endpoint is reachable and credentials are correct
- Check that `Agents::Instrumentation.install` returns the runner (returns nil if OTel is unavailable)

### Spans not appearing in Langfuse

- Verify the endpoint includes `/api/public/otel/v1/traces`
- Check that the Authorization header uses `Basic` (not `Bearer`) with base64-encoded `pk:sk`
- Use `BatchSpanProcessor` for production; `SimpleSpanProcessor` can be useful for debugging
- **SSL CRL errors on Ruby 3.4+**: The OTLP exporter silently fails when SSL certificate revocation list (CRL) checks fail. The exporter reports SUCCESS but no data arrives. Fix by passing `ssl_verify_mode: OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE` to the exporter in development, or ensure your system CA certificates are up to date

## End-to-end check

The optional Langfuse check stubs the model response, exports real OTel spans to your Langfuse project, and reads them back through the observations API. It covers a handoff, token usage, session and user attributes, and a failed tool. Set `LANGFUSE_HOST`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, then run:

```sh
RUN_LANGFUSE_E2E=1 bundle exec rspec spec/integration/langfuse_e2e_spec.rb
```

The model call is stubbed, so this check does not require a provider API key. Use the separate live LLM smoke suite when you also need to check provider access.
